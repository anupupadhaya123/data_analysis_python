Police Dataset Analysis
In this project, we analyze a dataset related to police records. Using Pandas, we perform operations like checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the first few rows of data, and filtering data based on specific criteria.

Weather Dataset Analysis
In this project, we analyze a weather dataset. We use Pandas to explore the data, perform operations like checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the shape of the dataset, and filtering data based on specific conditions.

Udemy Dataset Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to Udemy courses. We utilize Pandas to investigate the data, perform tasks such as checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the dataset's dimensions, and filtering data based on specific criteria.

COVID Dataset Analysis
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing COVID-19 information. Using Pandas, we explore the data, apply methods like checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the dataset's structure, and filtering data based on specific conditions.

Car Dataset Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about cars. Utilizing Pandas, we investigate the data, perform operations such as checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the dataset's shape, and filtering data based on specific criteria.

Census Dataset Analysis
In this project, we analyze a census dataset. Using Pandas, we explore the data, perform tasks like checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the dataset's structure, and filtering data based on specific conditions.

London Housing Dataset Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to housing in London. Leveraging Pandas, we investigate the data, perform operations such as checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the dataset's shape, and filtering data based on specific criteria.

Netflix Data Analysis
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing information about Netflix shows. Using Pandas, we explore the data, apply methods like checking for null values, finding unique values, examining the dataset's structure, and filtering data based on specific conditions.
